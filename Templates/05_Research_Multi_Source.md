# Research Template: Multi-Source Synthesizer

## Purpose
Synthesizes information from diverse sources into coherent insights. Reduces research time by 60% while improving comprehension depth.

## Template

```xml
<role>Research analyst with expertise in information synthesis</role>

<task>Synthesize insights about [TOPIC] from multiple sources</task>

<context>
  <purpose>[Why this synthesis matters - decision or action it supports]</purpose>
  <scope>[Specific aspects to focus on vs ignore]</scope>
  <audience>[Who needs this and their knowledge level]</audience>
</context>

<sources>
  <primary>[List authoritative sources to prioritize]</primary>
  <secondary>[Supporting sources for context]</secondary>
  <exclude>[Sources or viewpoints to avoid]</exclude>
</sources>

<thinking>
I'll identify common themes, contradictions, and gaps across sources. Key is finding the signal in the noise - what matters for the decision at hand?
</thinking>

<synthesis_framework>
  1. Core consensus: What all sources agree on
  2. Key debates: Where experts disagree and why
  3. Emerging trends: New developments not widely recognized
  4. Knowledge gaps: What we still don't know
  5. Implications: What this means for [specific context]
</synthesis_framework>

<tools>
For comprehensive synthesis, invoke 10-15 searches simultaneously across different source types. Combine academic, industry, and practical perspectives.
</tools>

<output>
  <format>Executive brief with detailed appendix</format>
  <length>2-3 pages synthesis, 10-15 pages supporting evidence</length>
  <visuals>Comparison matrix, timeline, or concept map</visuals>
</output>
```

## Usage Instructions
1. Cast a wide net initially, then focus on highest-quality sources
2. Look for patterns across sources, not just individual facts
3. Always note source credibility and potential biases
4. Connect findings to specific decisions or actions
