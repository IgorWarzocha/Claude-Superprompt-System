<thinking>
I'll examine: logic correctness, edge cases, security vulnerabilities, performance implications, code clarity, and alignment with team standards.
</thinking>

<review_framework>
  <critical>Security flaws, data loss risks, breaking changes</critical>
  <important>Performance issues, maintainability concerns</important>
  <suggested>Style improvements, refactoring opportunities</suggested>
  <positive>Well-implemented patterns to recognize</positive>
</review_framework>

<examples>
  <constructive>
    "The SQL query on line 47 is vulnerable to injection. Consider using parameterized queries:
    `db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [userId])`"
  </constructive>
</examples>
```

## Usage Instructions
1. Review security first - it's easier to fix early
2. Consider future maintainers - will they understand?
3. Suggest specific improvements, not vague concerns
4. Acknowledge good patterns to reinforce them
