# Tool Usage Patterns in Claude's System Prompts

Understanding how Claude is programmed to use tools reveals profound insights about building effective AI systems. Let's explore these patterns like we're learning a new instrument - first understanding the basics, then mastering the nuances.

## The Decision Tree: A Mental Model for Tool Usage

Imagine you're teaching someone when to use a calculator versus mental math. You wouldn't tell them to calculate 2+2 on a calculator, nor would you expect them to divide 3,847 by 293 in their head. Claude's tool usage follows a similar logic, but with fascinating complexity.

The system prompt creates a sophisticated decision tree that Claude follows. At the root of this tree is a fundamental question: "Can I answer this with my existing knowledge?" This branches into three paths that we can think of as traffic lights.

Green light scenarios are those where Claude proceeds without tools. These include timeless facts, established knowledge, and conceptual explanations. When you ask about the speed of light or how photosynthesis works, Claude knows these answers are stable across time.

Yellow light scenarios trigger a two-step process. Claude first provides its best answer, then offers to search for updates. This happens with information that changes slowly - think annual statistics, demographic data, or organizational leadership. The beauty of this approach is that users get immediate value while maintaining awareness that fresher data might exist.

Red light scenarios demand immediate tool use. Current weather, stock prices, or yesterday's news fall into this category. Claude doesn't guess or extrapolate - it searches first, then answers based on fresh data.

## The Complexity Scaling System

Here's where things get particularly elegant. Claude doesn't just decide whether to use tools - it scales the number of tool calls based on task complexity. Think of this like a chef deciding how many ingredients to use based on the dish's complexity.

For simple verification tasks, Claude uses 2-4 tool calls. This might be checking a single fact across multiple sources or finding one specific piece of information. It's like making a sandwich - you need bread, filling, and maybe a condiment.

Multi-source analysis triggers 5-9 tool calls. This could be comparing products, analyzing trends, or synthesizing viewpoints. Think of this as preparing a full meal - multiple dishes that need to complement each other.

Deep research can trigger 10-20 tool calls. These are comprehensive investigations, detailed reports, or complex problem-solving tasks. This is like catering a banquet - every element must be carefully sourced and orchestrated.

## The Internal-First Principle

One of the most revealing aspects of the system prompt is its emphasis on internal tools. Claude is instructed to prioritize company data, internal documents, and organizational resources before turning to the web. This reflects a sophisticated understanding of information hierarchy and reliability.

Think of it like researching your family history. You'd start with family documents and photos before turning to public records. Similarly, Claude checks internal sources first because they're often more relevant and authoritative for organization-specific queries.

## Learning from the Pattern

What can we take from this? When we design prompts that involve tool usage, we should be explicit about our expectations. Instead of vague instructions like "research this topic," we can specify depth: "Conduct a quick verification (2-3 sources)" or "Perform comprehensive research with 10+ sources including internal documents."

We can also adopt the internal-first principle in our prompts. When asking Claude to analyze something related to our organization, we can explicitly instruct: "First check our internal documentation and data, then supplement with external research if needed."

The complexity scaling teaches us to match our tool usage to our ambitions. Don't use a sledgehammer to crack a nut, but don't try to demolish a wall with a tack hammer either. By understanding how Claude scales its effort, we can better calibrate our requests to get optimal results efficiently.
