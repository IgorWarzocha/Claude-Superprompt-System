# Seven Lessons from Claude 4 System Prompt Analysis

Let's explore the seven groundbreaking techniques discovered through analyzing Claude 4's leaked system prompt. Think of these lessons as learning the secret techniques of a master craftsman by studying their work - each insight builds on the previous one to create a comprehensive understanding.

## Lesson 1: Matching Conversation Types Like a Chameleon

Imagine you're at a dinner party. You wouldn't speak to a child the same way you'd address a CEO, nor would you use the same tone for consoling a friend as you would for explaining a technical concept. Claude's system prompt reveals a sophisticated approach to this social intelligence.

The prompt instructs Claude to adapt its communication style based on context. For casual conversations, it keeps responses short and conversational, avoiding the formality of lists or structured presentations. When the discussion turns technical, however, Claude shifts gears entirely - embracing bullet points, detailed explanations, and systematic organization.

This teaches us a fundamental principle: our prompts should explicitly guide this adaptation. Instead of hoping Claude will infer the appropriate tone, we can specify it directly. For instance, when seeking emotional support, we might prompt: "Respond as a warm, understanding friend would - keep your tone natural and conversational." For technical tasks: "Provide a structured analysis with clear sections and bullet points where appropriate."

The beauty of this approach lies in its intentionality. By explicitly routing our conversations through different "modes," we get responses that feel more natural and appropriate to the context. It's like having a single assistant who can seamlessly switch between being your empathetic counselor, technical advisor, and creative collaborator.

## Lesson 2: The "Know, Maybe, Now" Decision Framework

This lesson reveals one of the most elegant decision trees in AI prompting. Picture a librarian deciding whether to answer from memory, check their card catalog, or visit the archives. Claude follows a similar three-path system that we can leverage in our own prompts.

The "Know" path activates for stable, timeless information. When you ask about mathematical constants, historical events, or scientific principles, Claude responds immediately from its training. This is efficient and appropriate - there's no need to search for what the speed of light is or when World War II ended.

The "Maybe" path represents a sophisticated middle ground. For information that changes annually or slowly - like population statistics, company leadership, or economic indicators - Claude provides its best answer first, then offers to search for updates. This approach respects both efficiency and accuracy. Users get immediate value while remaining aware that fresher data might exist.

The "Now" path triggers immediate search for anything time-sensitive. Stock prices, weather conditions, breaking news, or anything with temporal markers like "yesterday" or "current" bypasses Claude's training entirely in favor of real-time information.

Understanding this framework transforms how we structure our prompts. We can explicitly invoke the appropriate path: "Using your training knowledge, explain..." for stable facts, or "Search for the latest information on..." for current events. This clarity eliminates ambiguity and ensures we get the type of response we actually need.

## Lesson 3: Trust But Verify - The Anti-Sycophancy Protocol

Here's a fascinating revelation: Claude is specifically programmed not to be a yes-person. In a world where AI assistants often err on the side of excessive agreeability, Claude's system prompt includes explicit instructions to think critically when users claim the AI made an error.

Think of this like a good editor who doesn't just accept every suggested change but carefully considers whether the correction actually improves the work. When a user says "You're wrong about X," Claude doesn't immediately capitulate. Instead, it's instructed to think through the issue carefully before responding.

This teaches us something profound about effective prompting: we should expect and even encourage this kind of intellectual integrity. Rather than being frustrated if Claude pushes back on a correction, we can see it as the system working as intended. We can even leverage this in our prompts: "Please verify this information and let me know if any of my assumptions seem incorrect."

The anti-sycophancy protocol also reveals why vague criticism doesn't work well with Claude. Saying "That's wrong" is less effective than "I believe the population figure should be 8.3 million, not 7.9 million, based on the 2020 census." Specific, factual pushback triggers the most thoughtful response.
