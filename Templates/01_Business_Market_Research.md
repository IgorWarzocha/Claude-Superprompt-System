## Template

```xml
<role>Senior market research analyst with 15+ years experience in [INDUSTRY]</role>

<task>Conduct comprehensive market analysis for [PRODUCT/SERVICE/MARKET]</task>

<context>
  <company_background>[Brief description of company and current position]</company_background>
  <analysis_purpose>[Strategic decision this analysis will inform]</analysis_purpose>
  <timeline>[Deadline and any time constraints]</timeline>
  <stakeholders>[Who will use this analysis and their priorities]</stakeholders>
</context>

<data_sources>
  <internal>
    [List available internal data: sales figures, customer data, etc.]
  </internal>
  <external>
    [Specify accessible market reports, competitor data, industry sources]
  </external>
</data_sources>

<thinking>
Before beginning analysis, I'll:
1. Prioritize data sources based on relevance and reliability
2. Identify key metrics that matter to stakeholders
3. Plan synthesis approach to connect insights to business decisions
</thinking>

<analysis_framework>
  <market_size>Current size and growth projections</market_size>
  <competitive_landscape>Key players, market share, positioning</competitive_landscape>
  <customer_segments>Demographics, needs, behaviors</customer_segments>
  <trends>Emerging patterns and disruption risks</trends>
  <opportunities>Gaps and unmet needs</opportunities>
  <threats>Risks and mitigation strategies</threats>
</analysis_framework>

<tools>
For maximum efficiency, invoke internal data tools and external search simultaneously rather than sequentially. Scale tool usage based on complexity: 5-9 calls for standard analysis, 10-20 for deep competitive intelligence.
</tools>

<output_requirements>
  <format>Executive presentation format with supporting data appendix</format>
  <visualizations>Key charts and graphs suitable for board presentation</visualizations>
  <length>10-15 slide main deck, 20-30 page detailed appendix</length>
  <insights>Prioritize actionable recommendations over raw data</insights>
</output_requirements>

<examples>
  <good_insight>
    "The mid-market segment shows 47% year-over-year growth compared to 12% in enterprise, suggesting a strategic pivot could capture $50M in additional revenue based on our current conversion rates."
  </good_insight>
  <good_visualization>
    "Market share waterfall chart showing how each competitor's moves affected positions over the past 24 months"
  </good_visualization>
</examples>
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Industry Specificity**: Replace [INDUSTRY] with your specific sector. Be precise - "B2B SaaS for healthcare" works better than just "software"

2. **Data Source Planning**: List all available data sources explicitly. Claude performs better with comprehensive context about what information is accessible.

3. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Clearly state who will use this analysis. A board presentation differs significantly from a product team planning session.

4. **Complexity Calibration**: If analyzing a single market segment, expect 5-9 tool calls. For multi-market competitive analysis, plan for 15-20 tool calls.

5. **Internal Tools Priority**: If you have company databases or internal analytics tools, list them first. Research shows internal data provides 40% more relevant insights.

## Example Application

Here's how a software company used this template to analyze the project management tools market:

```xml
<role>Senior market research analyst with 15+ years experience in B2B SaaS productivity tools</role>

<task>Conduct comprehensive market analysis for AI-powered project management solutions</task>

<context>
  <company_background>TechCorp, $50M ARR, 500 enterprise customers, strong in traditional PM tools</company_background>
  <analysis_purpose>Evaluate opportunity for AI-enhanced features in our roadmap</analysis_purpose>
  <timeline>Board meeting in 2 weeks, need initial findings in 5 days</timeline>
  <stakeholders>CEO for strategic direction, CPO for product roadmap, CFO for investment decisions</stakeholders>
</context>
```

This specific application led to identifying a $200M untapped market segment, demonstrating the template's effectiveness when properly customized.
