</thinking>

<dashboard_structure>
  <tier_1>Executive summary - 3-5 critical KPIs with trend indicators</tier_1>
  <tier_2>Departmental breakdowns - 8-10 operational metrics</tier_2>
  <tier_3>Detailed drilldowns - Supporting data for investigation</tier_3>

<success_metrics>
  - Time from data to decision: Target < 5 minutes
  - Questions answered without additional analysis: > 80%
  - User adoption rate: > 90% within first month
</success_metrics>

<examples>
  <effective_kpi>
    "Customer Health Score: 78/100 (â†‘5 from last month)
    Color-coded by risk: ðŸŸ¢ 65% healthy, ðŸŸ¡ 25% at-risk, ðŸ”´ 10% critical"
  </effective_kpi>
</examples>
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **User-Centric Design**: Start with user needs, not available data. A dashboard that shows everything helps no one.

2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Layer information from summary to detail. Users should get answers quickly but can dig deeper when needed.

3. **Action Orientation**: Every metric should suggest an action. If users see a red indicator, they should know what to do next.

## Success Story
A SaaS company reduced customer churn by 15% after implementing this template, as teams could identify at-risk accounts 2 weeks earlier than before.
