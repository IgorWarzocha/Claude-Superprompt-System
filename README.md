## 🚀 Quick Start

### How to Set Up the Project in Claude Desktop

First, get all the project files onto your computer.

* [**Download from GitHub**](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha/Claude-Superprompt-System)
* [**Download as a ZIP file**](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha/Claude-Superprompt-System/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)

Unzip the folder if necessary and place it somewhere you can easily find. Then, follow the guide below that best fits your needs.

### Installation

### Method 1: Quick & Easy (For Free Users)

This is the simplest way to get started, and it doesn't use a dedicated Project. 

1.  **Type or paste this into a new chat window:**

```
Tell me how to install Desktop Commander from https://desktopcommander.app/ . I do not know much about computers.
```

This will allow you to document your progress and save your templates.

2.  **Open a fresh chat window. Upload `README.MD` and `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS.MD` and type or paste (change the folder path to match with your downloaded files):**

```
I've got Desktop Commander already installed. I am on a free subscription.
Use `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS.MD` as your system instructions.
Use  files in `C:\Your_Folder_Path\Claude-Superprompt-System` as your sources.
```

This should initialise the dialogue. If it doesn't, tell Claude to initialise using `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS.MD`

3.  **Start chatting.**

---

### Method 2: Official Project (For Claude Pro Subscribers)

This method uses Claude's "Projects" feature for the most reliable performance.

1.  **Create a New Project:** Open Claude and start a new Project.
2.  **Provide Files:** You have two options:
    * **Option A (Upload):** Upload all the downloaded files directly into the new Project.
    * **Option B (Use a Tool):** Use a tool like [Desktop Commander](https://desktopcommander.app/) to point Claude to the folder where you saved the files.
3.  **Set the System Prompt:**
    * Open the file named `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS.MD` on your computer.
    * Copy all the text inside that file.
    * In Claude, paste the text into the **System Prompt** field for your Project.
4.  **Start Chatting:** You're all set. Begin your conversation with Claude.

### First Interaction:
Claude will:
1. Greet you and explain the system
2. Ask whether you want Basic or Pro mode
3. Guide you through any necessary setup
4. Begin helping you master prompt engineering

*If it doesn't, tell it to initialise using `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS.MD`*
